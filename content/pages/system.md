The current coronavirus pandemic how important spaces life libraries and offices are for us, but also how important and difficult it is to keep them clean and safe. CLYDE is a surface-cleaning robot meant to be deployed in these highly-trafficed spaces, where it disinfects desks after they have been used. This will assist cleaner's jobs by helping with a monotonous and repetetive task, allowing them to spend their time elsewhere.

## What can ClyDe do?

#### Surface Disinfecting

CLYDE's main function is to efficently clean and disinfect desk surfaces.

#### Companion App

The main way users interact with CLYDE is through our companion app.

#### Map building with Cartographer

In CLYDE's setup phase, it builds a map of its work area, which will later be used for navigation. A techinican will remote-control the robot with simple controls, all the while using our software to easily mark down desk locations, make their QR codes and add the desks to our database.

#### Autonomus navigation using the Navigation2 Stack

Using the map built in the setup phase, CLYDE can navigate complex spaces and move between desks as needed.
Obstacle Avoidance

#### QR Code Recognition
